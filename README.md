rRNA_pipeline v0.4 (May 21, 2016)
Full ssu-rRNA, swarm OTU classification pipeline

Usage: rRNA_pipeline.py (options)
   -d name          : database name (16S, 18S, V4, V9)
   -q dir           : FASTQ folder
   -o file          : base filename for results (default: rrna)
   -n file          : sample names file (optional)
   -p               : calculate/plot OTU purity
   -m int           : minimum quality score for FASTQ (default: 30)
   -s, --steps list : run only the steps in list (default: All)
   -t, --cpus int   : number of processes (default: 1)
   -w               : no overwrite of files, skip completed steps (default)
   -W, --overwrite  : overwrite files (default if -s)
   -h, --help       : help
   -v, --verbose    : more information to stderr

   If -s is used, then -W overwrite is the default
   Steps list can include any of the following: 
      All, merge_fastq, chimera, filter_fasta, derep
      swarm, classify, plots, purity, split_plastid
      plastid_classify, plastid_plots, plastid_purity

Example: rRNA_pipeline.py -d 16S -q ./fastq
```

If using alternate databases for 16S, Plastid, 18S, 18S_V4, or 18S_V9, specify paths in init.txt.

**Basic operation for 16S:**
```bash
rRNA_pipeline.py -d 16S -q ./fastq
```

To replace FASTQ filenames with sample names in all output, use -n to specify tab-delimited file (sample_name, FASTQ base name).  FASTQ base names may be followed by any of [_R1, _R2, .filtered, .fastq, .fq] in the full FASTQ file name.  

The basic pipeline runs relatively quickly, however the extra calculation of OTU purity takes much longer.  Use -p to calculate and plot purity.

**Use the following for 18S V4, with sample names, run on 4 CPUs, with purity plot:**
```bash
rRNA_pipeline.py -d V4 -o rrna -n sample_names.txt -t 4 -p
```

The rRNA pipeline will skip previous steps if stopped and rerun, unless -W is specified.  To rerun starting at a particular step, delete the output files created during that step, and run again.  To run only specific steps, use -s and specify steps by name.  Spaces are not allowed unless the list is bound by quotes.  If -s is used then -W is the default and files will be overwritten unless -w is given.

**Use the following for 18S V9, running only derep, swarm, and classify steps:**
```bash
rRNA_pipeline.py -d V9 -s "derep,swarm,classify"
```

*Output files, created in the following order:*

| File | Description |

| fqbase1.assembled.fastq | Pear merged paired reads
| fqbase1.discarded.fastq | Pear unmerged reads
| fqbase1.unassembled.forward.fastq | Pear unmerged reads R1 
| fqbase1.unassembled.reverse.fastq | Pear unmerged reads R2

| rrna.swarm.purity.pdf | plot of swarm purity |

(multiple paired FASTQ base filename *'fqbase1'*, and single output base filename *'rrna'*)

In the case of 16S, files are split into two groups: those that are classified as plastid, and those that are not (determined by *'rrna.swarm.ggsearch'*).  The non-plastid rows/sequences are written over the base *'rrna'* files, and the plastid 16S rows/sequences are written to a separate set of files, *'rrna.plastid'*, and swarm OTUs are re-classified by the phytoRef database.

Installation
------------

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed (see below), and make them accessible to your path.
2. Databases for 18S V4/V9 derived from PR2 with updated taxonomy are included in db/.  Use gunzip to uncompress these files.
3. Download the full PR2 database (http://ssu-rrna.org/), and add to db/ if you want to use other regions of 18S
4. Download SILVA NR database (http://www.arb-silva.de/), and add to db/ if you want to use 16S
5. Test the rRNA pipeline:

```bash
rRNA_pipeline.py --test
```

Uncompressing the db/ files and running the test can also be accomplished with make
```bash
make
```

If you are having trouble with usearch or want to skip the chimera checking for any reason, then edit the init.txt file to turn it off:
```
chimera: off
```
